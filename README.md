## My process

This is my first finished Frontend Mentor Challenge, all feedback welcome. My process was chaotic, but I have learnt a lot. I hope that this experience can lead to less chaotic process in the future.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I have been very satisfied with my Accordion Card... and then I resized the window. That is when I read about the "mobile first" idea. It was not implemented here, but I will try to do it in the next project I start from scratch.

### Continued development

In the next phase of my learning I would like to try: mobile first development, as well as focusing on quality. I can't help but feel that my code is held by a duct tape and a chewing gum. That is why I ask especially for feedback on the following aspects:

- how to position the background better
- how to position the image and the box icon so that they work well together (while resizing the screen)
- how to write clean CSS when it comes to mobile queries (here I put entire blocks for various screen sizes one under the other - is this how it's done or is there some better way to write that code?)

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS Best Practices](https://dev.to/codewithtee/15-html-and-css-good-practices-4608) - I used this as a guideline when it comes to HTML tags and CSS style order.
